# MyReads Project

 This is a bookshelf app that allows you to select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read.
 The main page also has a link to /search, a search page that allows you to find books to add to your library.

## TL;DR

To get started and test myReads project:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
